Ukrainian food price application

This is my application for NMIT Semester 2 of 2022, SDV602 class tutored by Todd Cochrane. 
The intention of this application is to track the prices of food in the war torn country of the Ukraine. I do not personally agree with any form of war, I am just studying the effects
on the people in different areas of the Ukraine that are affected by the war. 

This application may take a dataset of the Ukraine and produce results to be displayed graphically on the prices of items, in the future I aim to make this application have the ability 
to adapt to different countries and different options datasets allow. 

This application's current state is a test state, accepting a dataset which produces results graphically on the prices of foods selected from a list 

The application uses the libraries:
    - PySimpleGUI   (For layout and presentation of windows in graphical user interface)
    - Matplotlib    (For layout of graphs to insert into the windows generated by PySimpleGUI)
    - Tkinter       (To generate message boxes to display errors or unexpected results)
    - Pandas        (To manipulate and analyse data)

Please refer to 'GUIV2' for the current, working version with updates to refresh graphs based on user interaction and manipulation of data to retreive information required 

Enjoy!
